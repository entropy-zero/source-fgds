# source-fgds

This repo contains two branches.

* "master" contains the original FGDs from before Mapbase's changes.
* "mapbase" contains Mapbase's changes to the original FGDs.
  
This allows readers to see what Mapbase changed in the FGDs and makes it easier to merge a mod's own modified FGDs with Mapbase's FGDs, as they could create a new branch from "master" and merge from the "mapbase" branch.

The original FGD files were created by Valve for the Source SDK.
